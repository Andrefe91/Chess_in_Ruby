# Ruby Chess Game

This is a command-line chess game implemented in Ruby as the final project for the Ruby module in The Odin Project curriculum. This project encompasses all the knowledge and skills gained throughout the course, allowing for a genuine chess experience between two human players.

## Features

- **Valid Movements:** The game is designed to recognize and enforce all legal movements for each chess piece, ensuring that players can only make valid moves according to the rules of the game.
- **Save and Load:** The implementation includes the ability to save the current game progress and load it later, allowing players to continue a match at a later time.
- **Two Player Mode:** This game is designed for two human players to play against each other, simulating a traditional chess match.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Ruby installed on your machine.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `ruby chess_game.rb` in the /lib subfolder to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
5. To save a game, follow the in-game prompts to save the current state. To load a saved game, select the appropriate option when starting the game.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `lib/`: Contains all the Ruby classes and methods required for the game logic.
- `spec/`: Includes the test suite for various components of the game.

## Future Improvements

- Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Develop a graphical interface for a more user-friendly experience.
